	  The Hanlon Foundation was established in 1999 by Molly and
	    Michael Hanlon. We are located in Seattle, Washington. The
	    foundation makes investments in organizations that add
	    value to communities to which we belong.

	  <P>We are a small family foundation, and thus we do not
	    acccept unsolicited proposals. Thanks and best regards.
